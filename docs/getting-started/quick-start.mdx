# Quick Start

This guide gets you from zero to a working AI agent in under 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://mudabbir.xyz/install.sh | sh
```
On **Windows PowerShell**, use:

```powershell
powershell -NoExit -Command "iwr -useb https://mudabbir.xyz/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Tip:** If the install command fails, make sure Python 3.11+ is installed and available in your system PATH.


## Step 2: Set Your API Key

```bash
export MUDABBIR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"
```

## Step 3: Launch

```bash
mudabbir
```

This starts the **web dashboard** at `http://localhost:8888`. Open it in your browser.

## Step 4: Chat

Type a message in the chat input and press Enter. Mudabbir will process it through the Claude Agent SDK and stream the response back in real-time.

Try these example prompts:

- "What files are in my home directory?"
- "Write a Python script that calculates prime numbers"
- "Search the web for the latest news about AI"

## Running Headless Channels

You can also run Mudabbir as a headless bot on specific channels:

```bash
# Telegram only (legacy pairing flow)
mudabbir --telegram

# Discord only
mudabbir --discord

# Slack only
mudabbir --slack

# Multiple channels
mudabbir --discord --slack --whatsapp

# All configured channels
mudabbir  # Default web dashboard auto-starts configured adapters
```
