# Installation

Mudabbir requires **Python 3.11+** and can be installed via pip or uv.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11** or higher
- **pip**, **uv**, or **pipx** package manager
- An **Anthropic API key** (for cloud models) or **Ollama** (for local models — no API key needed)

## Quick Install

The fastest way to get started — the interactive installer handles Python, uv, and feature selection:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://mudabbir.xyz/install.sh | sh
````

### Windows PowerShell Note

> On **Windows PowerShell**, the above command **will fail** because `sh` is not recognized.

```text
sh : The term 'sh' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet...
```

**Workarounds:**

1. Use PowerShell-specific script (if available):

```powershell
# Set execution policy to allow scripts
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Run Mudabbir installer
powershell -NoExit -Command "iwr -useb https://mudabbir.xyz/install.ps1 | iex"
```

2. Use **Git Bash** or **WSL** to run the original Unix install script.

Or install directly with pip:

```bash
pip install mudabbir
```

This installs the core package with minimal dependencies (~10 packages). To add specific features, use extras.

## Using uv (Recommended)

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is the recommended package manager for faster installs:

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and install for development
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed5754/Mudabbir.git
cd mudabbir
uv sync --dev

# Run with auto-reload for development
uv run mudabbir --dev
```

## Package Extras

Mudabbir uses a modular extras system. Install only what you need:

### Channel Extras

```bash
# Individual channels
pip install mudabbir[telegram]
pip install mudabbir[discord]
pip install mudabbir[slack]
pip install mudabbir[whatsapp-personal]  # QR-code pairing

# All channels
pip install mudabbir[all-channels]
```

### Tool Extras

```bash
# Specific tools
pip install mudabbir[browser]    # Playwright browser automation
pip install mudabbir[image]      # Google Gemini image generation
pip install mudabbir[memory]     # Mem0 semantic memory

# All tools
pip install mudabbir[all-tools]
```

### Backend Extras

```bash
pip install mudabbir[native]     # Mudabbir Native backend
pip install mudabbir[desktop]    # Desktop automation tools
```

### Composite Extras

```bash
# Recommended setup (dashboard + common tools)
pip install mudabbir[recommended]

# Everything included
pip install mudabbir[all]

# Development (includes test and lint tools)
pip install mudabbir[dev]
```

## Environment Variables

Set your API keys as environment variables. All Mudabbir settings use the `MUDABBIR_` prefix:

```bash
# Option A: Anthropic API key for Claude (cloud)
export MUDABBIR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Option B: Ollama for local models (no API key needed)
export MUDABBIR_LLM_PROVIDER="ollama"
export MUDABBIR_OLLAMA_MODEL="qwen2.5:7b"

# Optional: Other API keys
export MUDABBIR_OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."          # For voice/TTS/STT
export MUDABBIR_TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-..."        # For web search
export MUDABBIR_GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."             # For image generation
export MUDABBIR_BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY="..."       # For Brave Search
```

Alternatively, you can configure these through the web dashboard's settings panel.

## Docker

For server deployments, Mudabbir includes a production-ready `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed5754/Mudabbir.git
cd mudabbir
cp .env.example .env    # fill in your API keys
docker compose up -d
```

The image includes all extras, Playwright Chromium, and OCR support. See the [Docker deployment guide](/deployment/docker) for optional Ollama/Qdrant services and configuration details.

## Verify Installation

```bash
# Run Mudabbir (starts web dashboard)
mudabbir

# Or with uv
uv run mudabbir
```

The web dashboard will start at `http://localhost:8888`. Open it in your browser to verify everything is working.
